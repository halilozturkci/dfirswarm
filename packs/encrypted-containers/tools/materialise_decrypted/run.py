"""Write decrypted evidence under the job's output, from a key the case supplies in a sealed file; the key is never anywhere else.

A case supplies a BitLocker recovery password, a LUKS password or an AES Crypt password; an examiner then needs the plaintext as a durable
file, with where it came from. This tool does that, for three approved operations, through the readers the pack pins as Python modules:

    bitlocker_image   pybde: the volume at a byte offset of the source, unlocked with a recovery password, a password, a startup key file or
                      the clear key (no secret), written as a raw image of the unlocked volume.
    luks_image        pyluksde: a LUKS volume unlocked with a password, written as a raw image.
    aescrypt_decrypt  pyAesCrypt: an AES Crypt container decrypted to a file; the module checks the HMAC before it returns, and the file is only
                      named as a result after it has.

Selected files out of a volume are not provided: the raw image is the durable result, and a file system reader works on it afterwards.

The key reference is a path to a regular file of mode 0600 in the job (never a link, a pipe or a device; at most 4096 bytes). Its content is read
inside this tool and given to the module as an argument in memory: it is not on a command line (this tool starts no program), not in the
environment, not in an answer, a path, a key of the JSON or a file. A module's exception text is never shown, because it may quote the key: only
its class is. The tool runs only inside a job the harness ran as secret output (SECRET_OUTPUT=1; the manifest's secret_output: "required" makes
every job of this tool one) and refuses as JSON before it reads anything, its own stdin included, outside one.

Every output is first a file ending in .partial, created exclusively with mode 0600 under the job's output directory. A key that does not work
removes it (nothing is left); a result that is whole is placed under its final name without replacing a file that is there; a result that is
not whole (a cut or damaged container, the output budget, the time limit) is kept as .partial, named in the answer as unverified. A stop signal
leaves the .partial file and ends with one JSON answer and exit 128 + the signal. The answer carries the reader's name and version, the evidence's
size and sha256, the offset, which kind of key was used (the protector's identifier is not reported by the module), the output's size and sha256, and
the integrity checks that were made.
"""

# BEGIN SHARED ENDS
# The same text is in every pack tool and recipe and in their tool-library twins, before the file's own imports (tests/shared-blocks-census.test.ts
# holds the copies equal): the two ends of a call, where a stop signal (SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGHUP) found no handler, or one that did harm.
# * The start. From here a stop is answered by ONE JSON document and exit 128 + the signal, until the tool installs its own handlers (which then
#   answer it), and for good for a signal the tool never takes. Only the start of the interpreter and the compiling of the file come before
#   it: a stop there ends the process with no answer, before anything was read. answer_a_stop() is that document: a handler whose own last word
#   wrote nothing on standard output calls it before it ends the process, so that a stop is never answered by silence.
# * The end. The interpreter's own teardown resets the handlers to their defaults before it frees what the call held, and a stop that landed
#   there killed a process that had printed its whole answer; a handler that raises, writes a last word or ends the process, run once the
#   answer was decided, wrote a second document, a traceback, or nothing at all. Python runs a handler on the main thread whichever thread the
#   signal reached, so a mask of the main thread alone holds nothing while another thread runs. hold_stop_signals() holds the stop signals for
#   good: blocked in this thread and given a handler that does nothing, which is the hold whatever thread the signal reaches; an error Python
#   can only report from then on (a file left open whose last write the file system refuses, closed when the frame that held it is freed) is
#   not printed (3.11 and 3.12 say nothing of it, 3.14 a traceback). A handler that was due runs on the way in: what it raises reaches the
#   writer that asked (the tool's own handling then answers the stop, before any byte of the answer), or, quietly, is dropped (the end of a
#   call, an error branch). Every writer of a final answer calls it before it commits to writing, every error branch at the end calls it
#   quietly, and, when the file runs as a program, standard output is wrapped so that its first write calls it too. _code(stop) is a
#   SystemExit's exit code (its text, if it has one, goes to standard error as the interpreter puts it), and _leave(code) ends the call: both
#   hold the signals first, quietly; _leave flushes
#   standard output (a write that fails there makes a 0 an exit 120, as the interpreter does) and standard error, runs the atexit hooks (a hook
#   that removes a temporary file), each step on its own and none able to raise, and ends the process with os._exit, never through the teardown.

# assigned to (`password=`, a `Name`/`Value` pair, a `-Password` switch, `curl -u user:pass`, `mysql -pSECRET`), and the common
# token families, private key blocks and hashes of an account database. A name decides whether a value is a secret, a value
# decides nothing. Every rule runs in time linear in the text (a bounded stretch after each anchor, no nested repeat), and a
# carrier whose texts are long (a cloud log: a megabyte) sets WITHHOLD_TICK to a hook that ends the work at its deadline.

# BEGIN SHARED NAMES
# The same text is in recovery_key_scan, archive_probe and crypto_id (a pack test holds the copies equal). It decides what a name,
# a path, a header string or a diagnostic from evidence may show. Layer 1 (shown, withhold) cuts out of a string the spans that are
# shaped like an identifier or a secret and puts a fixed placeholder where each was (no length, no fragment); layer 2 (seal) reads
# every string of what is about to be printed or paged once more, by rules of its own, and replaces a string the first layer let
# through that still looks like a secret.
#
# WITHHELD, by shape: a recovery password (eight groups of six digits, joined by none to three characters that are not letters or digits)
# in a path component, whole component, and across the components of a path (the separators of a path join its groups); a run of 10 or
# more digits; a run of 8 or more letters and digits that has a digit in it (System32 and a few such names of Windows are let through); a
# letters-only run of 8 or more that is not one word, a camel-case word or all capitals; groups of 4 to 6 characters joined by one `-`, `_`
# or `.` (3 or more digit-only groups, or 4 or more groups that each hold a digit or are all capitals), and four or more groups of exactly
# six digits joined by spaces; the value after password, secret, token, api key, credential, auth (`password=...`); user-info; and the
# token shapes of the shared WITHHOLDING block above (vendor prefixes, JWT, long hex, long mixed runs, base64 with `/`). A string is also
# judged after NFKC, with invisible characters taken out and with the Cyrillic and Greek letters that look like Latin ones read as Latin,
# and a hit there that the string as written does not show withholds the whole string.
# NOT WITHHELD, by design: an identifier of 7 characters or fewer, a lowercase-only random run (it reads as a word), a secret that does
# not look like one, an all-capital letters-only run of any length, groups of other sizes (three groups of 4 to 6 letters and digits are
# printed), a recovery password cut into pieces by anything else than the separators above, and anything in the data a tool reads rather
# than prints.
# BOUNDED: the token rule of the WITHHOLDING block re-reads the text in front of a `/` once for each flagged piece after it, so its time
# grows with the square of a long run of name characters. What that block is given is therefore bounded first (_unjudgeable): a string of
# more than MAX_JUDGED characters, as written or after NFKC, or one that holds a `/` and a run of name characters of more than MAX_RUN, is
# withheld whole and not judged. The block itself is repaired at its source in a change of its own, for every pack that copies it.
# Measured on random draws and on real directory trees: tests/pack-encrypted-containers-names.test.ts and the manifests give the rates.

# BEGIN SHARED PROCESS
# The same text is in pcap_extract, zeek_run, suricata_run, the network-capture recipe and computer-forensics-base's
# archive_extract; tests/pack-network-withholding.test.ts holds the four network copies equal and tests/pack-base-shared.test.ts
# holds archive_extract's to them. A program an engine tool runs is started in THIS tool's process group, never in a session of
# its own: the harness ends a tool that runs too long, or is aborted, by killing the tool's group (process.kill(-pid,
# SIGKILL)), and an engine in a group of its own goes on writing into the output directory after the tool is gone. On
# Linux the kernel is also asked to kill it if the tool dies. A deadline kills the program and what it started by
# walking the process tree, and SIGTERM, SIGINT and SIGHUP do the same and then give the tool a last word. Only what is
# below a program this tool started and has not yet waited for is ever signalled: the walk starts at that program's pid
# and nowhere else, and a program that has been waited for (its pid may be another process's by now) is left alone. The
# walk is bounded (MAX_ROUNDS and WALK_SECONDS, below). A stop signal is the one case that reaches further: it also
# ends everything below the tool itself (a program that was forked a moment before it was entered in ACTIVE is among it) and what
# the tool started and lost (reap_orphans): a process that was seen below the tool, in the tool's own group, and whose parent has since
# ended. Nothing else is ever ended: a process the tool never saw in its tree (the next stage of a pipeline the tool heads, a process a
# launcher put in the group) is left alone, whoever leads the group. A program that has ended while something it started still
# holds its pipes does not hold the tool: communicate_bounded gives the pipes PIPE_GRACE seconds (and POST_EXIT_BYTES bytes) and goes on without them.
# The walk below a program is bounded: MAX_ROUNDS rounds and WALK_SECONDS seconds. Each process is stopped (SIGSTOP) as the walk finds it,
# so one that forks fast cannot outrun the walk; the walk is repeated for what the stopped ones had already forked, and the stopped set is
# then killed. A tree that is still growing at the bound is left, and process_notes() says so.
# Before a pid other than the program itself is signalled, its identity is read again (same_process(pid, ident)): the start time, from
# /proc/<pid>/stat (field 22, counted after the last ")") on Linux, from libproc's PROC_PIDTBSDINFO (pbi_start_tvsec, pbi_start_tvusec;
# written from <sys/proc_info.h>, not run on macOS in this repository's tests) on macOS, and from `ps -o lstart=` (to the second: coarse)
# where neither answers. The parent is no part of it: a child is re-parented when its parent ends, and is still the process that was
# listed. A pid that is gone, or whose start time is not the listed one, is left alone; a pid whose start time could not be read when it
# was listed is signalled only if it can be read now and is in the tool's own group; a ps listing that gave no start time (a minimal ps) is
# checked only for the pid still being there.
# A tree that cannot be listed (ps fails, lists nothing or needs more than PS_WAIT seconds, /proc cannot be read or takes more than
# TABLE_SECONDS) is never taken as an empty one: list_descendants raises TreeNotListed, the program itself is still ended, and a sentence
# in process_notes() says that the tree could not be listed (communicate_bounded also appends it to the stderr bytes it returns when it
# ended the program at its deadline). descendants() is list_descendants for a caller that cannot take an exception (a signal handler): its
# list is empty and has not_listed = True when the tree could not be listed.
# Open: a pid that ends and is reused between the identity check and the signal (two calls) is signalled; the Linux rule that a member of
# the tool's own group that holds the tool's pipe is ended; on macOS a daemon that holds the pipes of a finished program is not found (no
# /proc/<pid>/fd); a tool SIGKILLed between the stop and the kill leaves the program and the stopped set stopped (the harness ends the
# tool's group, and with it the stopped ones that are in it); a carrier's answer carries program_group (process_verdict, process_notes)
# only where that carrier's own code calls process_apply (without the call a program's leftovers are ended but not reported); the start of the interpreter, before any handler is in, is a window a signal can land in.
# What a program leaves behind (settle). A program can exit by itself and leave a process that goes on writing a file the answer then reports:
# one in a session of its own, or one that holds none of the tool's descriptors, which neither the walk nor the pipes reach. On Linux spawn()
# makes the tool a subreaper (become_subreaper, PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER): such a process is adopted by the tool, so it is a direct child of the
# tool, and settle() ends it: when a program leaves ACTIVE after it has ended or been killed (ACTIVE is a list whose remove() does it), and at
# the end of communicate_bounded and inside kill_all. It ends only a child of the tool that is no program's own: not a program spawn() started
# (SPAWNED: Popen reaps those, their returncode is never taken), not one kept (KEEP, process_keep(pid), spawn(argv, leaves=True) for a
# program that leaves a process on purpose) and not a child the tool already had (PRE_KIDS). It stops each one, what it started with it (the
# walk above), kills and reaps them, for at most LEFTOVER_SECONDS, reading the clock for every process. While another program is running in
# ACTIVE nothing is ended and the answer says it is unproven. process_verdict() says what was found; process_apply(answer) puts it into an
# answer as program_group and turns a complete answer partial when a program left something or that could not be ruled out: a carrier
# calls it once where it prints its answer. Where nothing is adopted (not Linux, or the kernel refuses) settle() ends only what the tool saw
# below a program whose parent is gone, and the answer is unproven (NONLINUX_UNPROVEN_DOWNGRADE below is the one line that decides whether
# that alone makes a complete answer partial on a host that is not Linux). Not reached by any of this: a process that is not a descendant of
# a program (started through a service manager, a socket, another PID namespace), and the tool itself being killed (the harness ends its group).
# What a program's pipes deliver after it ended (the byte cap). communicate_bounded reads the pipes itself (a selector, not
# Popen.communicate) and looks at the program after every read. From the moment the program has ended, or been killed at its deadline, it
# takes at most POST_EXIT_BYTES (1 MiB) more bytes from its two pipes together and at most PIPE_GRACE seconds, whichever comes first; a
# program's own last words are in the pipe already (a pipe holds far less than the cap), so only what a process that went on holding the
# pipe wrote can be cut. At the cap the tool stops reading, ends the holder (reap_orphans, settle) and lets the pipes go: PIPE_CUT["cut"]
# counts the calls cut that way, process_notes() says so, and process_apply turns a complete answer partial. The bytes kept are the ones
# read, not a whole stream: a caller that parses the output sees the program's output and at most 1 MiB of what a leftover wrote. While the
# program is still alive nothing is capped here (a program's own output is its caller's to bound); the timing is unchanged.
