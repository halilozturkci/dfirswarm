"""Locate the key material that is already in the evidence, without reading it out.

Almost every container opened in a real case was opened with a key that was
sitting somewhere else in the same case. This sweep finds where, and says what
kind of thing it found. It never says what the thing is.

What it looks for:

    a BitLocker recovery password   48 digits in eight groups of six, in ASCII
                                    text or UTF-16LE text (Windows' own "save a
                                    recovery key" file is UTF-16LE)
    private keys                    the PEM header, with its type
    key files and databases         by name: .bek, id_*, kdbx, key4.db, the
                                    keychains, Login Data, logins.json,
                                    .ppk/.pem/.p12/.pfx, and the names people
                                    save a recovery key under

The 48-digit format carries its own check: each of the eight groups is a
multiple of eleven whose quotient is below 65536 (so no group is above 720885),
which removes almost every coincidental match. `passes_structure_check` says all
eight groups pass. It means a plausible transcription of a recovery password. It
does not mean the value opens any volume. A value with a failing group is still
reported, marked, because a partial transcription is a lead.

THE SECRET-SAFE OUTPUT PATTERN (docs/packs.md, "Secrets and sensitive output").
This tool is its reference implementation; a tool that can reach secret material
copies `SecretValues` below and follows the same rules.

  1. The answer carries presence, kind, location (file and offset), length and a
     structure result. It carries no value, no characters of one, no masked
     "shape" and no hash, digest or fingerprint of one, however short or salted.
     A finding's `finding_id` is a sequence number and is derived from nothing.
  2. A value is written only when the caller asks (`write_values: true`), only
     when the tool runs as a job (JOB_ID and OUT are set) that the harness ran as
     secret output (SECRET_OUTPUT=1 in the process; the manifest's `secret_output`
     makes a job with write_values one), and only to a file under $OUT. The skill
     that sends the agent here says the job runs with `secret_output: true`, which
     seals every output of the job as sensitive. Outside a job, or in a job that is
     not secret output, the request is refused and nothing is written.
  3. The value file is JSON Lines, mode 0600, created exclusively; each row
     names the same `finding_id`, file and offset as the answer. The answer
     names the file and says `contains_secret_values: true`.
  4. A secret is never on a command line. This tool takes a path and flags only.
  5. A path is printed with any component shaped like the secret withheld (a file or a
     directory named after a recovery password would otherwise print it), and so is a
     component shaped like any identifier or secret (the SHARED NAMES block says which
     shapes, and which are not recognised), in the answer, in the files it names and in
     the digest that names a paging file. The values file keeps the real path.
  6. What is about to be printed or paged is read once more by a check of its own (the
     output check); a string it finds suspect is replaced and the answer is partial.

A value is found when it is not glued to more digits: "key_<value>" and "(<value>)" are
found, "<value>7" and "7<value>" are not (a group of seven digits is no group).

The tool has its own clock (`max_seconds`, default 480, below the manifest's 600) and
stops on SIGTERM, SIGINT and SIGHUP: either way it finishes the pages it has, closes the
values file, and prints one answer that says it is partial, names the files it did not
read and the directories it did not enter, and exits (128 + the signal for a signal).
"""

# BEGIN SHARED ENDS
# The same text is in every pack tool and recipe and in their tool-library twins, before the file's own imports (tests/shared-blocks-census.test.ts
# holds the copies equal): the two ends of a call, where a stop signal (SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGHUP) found no handler, or one that did harm.
# * The start. From here a stop is answered by ONE JSON document and exit 128 + the signal, until the tool installs its own handlers (which then
#   answer it), and for good for a signal the tool never takes. Only the start of the interpreter and the compiling of the file come before
#   it: a stop there ends the process with no answer, before anything was read. answer_a_stop() is that document: a handler whose own last word
#   wrote nothing on standard output calls it before it ends the process, so that a stop is never answered by silence.
# * The end. The interpreter's own teardown resets the handlers to their defaults before it frees what the call held, and a stop that landed
#   there killed a process that had printed its whole answer; a handler that raises, writes a last word or ends the process, run once the
#   answer was decided, wrote a second document, a traceback, or nothing at all. Python runs a handler on the main thread whichever thread the
#   signal reached, so a mask of the main thread alone holds nothing while another thread runs. hold_stop_signals() holds the stop signals for
#   good: blocked in this thread and given a handler that does nothing, which is the hold whatever thread the signal reaches; an error Python
#   can only report from then on (a file left open whose last write the file system refuses, closed when the frame that held it is freed) is
#   not printed (3.11 and 3.12 say nothing of it, 3.14 a traceback). A handler that was due runs on the way in: what it raises reaches the
#   writer that asked (the tool's own handling then answers the stop, before any byte of the answer), or, quietly, is dropped (the end of a
#   call, an error branch). Every writer of a final answer calls it before it commits to writing, every error branch at the end calls it
#   quietly, and, when the file runs as a program, standard output is wrapped so that its first write calls it too. _code(stop) is a
#   SystemExit's exit code (its text, if it has one, goes to standard error as the interpreter puts it), and _leave(code) ends the call: both
#   hold the signals first, quietly; _leave flushes
#   standard output (a write that fails there makes a 0 an exit 120, as the interpreter does) and standard error, runs the atexit hooks (a hook
#   that removes a temporary file), each step on its own and none able to raise, and ends the process with os._exit, never through the teardown.
# The modules are imported here, as the file is loaded, never inside the ending (an import there ran a due handler inside the import system).

# BEGIN SHARED NAMES
# The same text is in recovery_key_scan, archive_probe and crypto_id (a pack test holds the copies equal). It decides what a name,
# a path, a header string or a diagnostic from evidence may show. Layer 1 (shown, withhold) cuts out of a string the spans that are
# shaped like an identifier or a secret and puts a fixed placeholder where each was (no length, no fragment); layer 2 (seal) reads
# every string of what is about to be printed or paged once more, by rules of its own, and replaces a string the first layer let
# through that still looks like a secret.
#
# WITHHELD, by shape: a recovery password (eight groups of six digits, joined by none to three characters that are not letters or digits)
# in a path component, whole component, and across the components of a path (the separators of a path join its groups); a run of 10 or
# more digits; a run of 8 or more letters and digits that has a digit in it (System32 and a few such names of Windows are let through); a
# letters-only run of 8 or more that is not one word, a camel-case word or all capitals; groups of 4 to 6 characters joined by one `-`, `_`
# or `.` (3 or more digit-only groups, or 4 or more groups that each hold a digit or are all capitals), and four or more groups of exactly
# six digits joined by spaces; the value after password, secret, token, api key, credential, auth (`password=...`); user-info; and the
# token shapes of the shared WITHHOLDING block above (vendor prefixes, JWT, long hex, long mixed runs, base64 with `/`). A string is also
# judged after NFKC, with invisible characters taken out and with the Cyrillic and Greek letters that look like Latin ones read as Latin,
# and a hit there that the string as written does not show withholds the whole string.
# NOT WITHHELD, by design: an identifier of 7 characters or fewer, a lowercase-only random run (it reads as a word), a secret that does
# not look like one, an all-capital letters-only run of any length, groups of other sizes (three groups of 4 to 6 letters and digits are
# printed), a recovery password cut into pieces by anything else than the separators above, and anything in the data a tool reads rather
# than prints.
# BOUNDED: the token rule of the WITHHOLDING block re-reads the text in front of a `/` once for each flagged piece after it, so its time
# grows with the square of a long run of name characters. What that block is given is therefore bounded first (_unjudgeable): a string of
# more than MAX_JUDGED characters, as written or after NFKC, or one that holds a `/` and a run of name characters of more than MAX_RUN, is
# withheld whole and not judged. The block itself is repaired at its source in a change of its own, for every pack that copies it.
# Measured on random draws and on real directory trees: tests/pack-encrypted-containers-names.test.ts and the manifests give the rates.
