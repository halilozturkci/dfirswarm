"""Read the FSEvents log: what changed on this volume, in order, and what was not read.

macOS writes a per-volume change log into /.fseventsd for Spotlight and backup
software. It records the path, not the contents, so it can describe a file that
is gone. It is a change-notification history, not a complete audit: records are
coalesced, files roll off, and a volume's log can be absent, damaged or restored.

Each record file is gzip, sometimes several members end to end, and holds pages:

    page header (12 bytes): magic "1SLD" or "2SLD", 4 bytes of unknown, the page
                            length as u32 little-endian, header included
    then records to the end of the page:
        path, NUL-terminated UTF-8
        event id (u64)
        flags (u32)
        node id (u64), version 2 only

**There is no timestamp anywhere in the format.** Event ids are a counter within
one volume's log. They order records; they do not date them.

Only the two page versions above are read. A page whose magic has the shape of a
page header and is another version (3SLD, say) is `unsupported`, named with the
magic seen and where, and the rest of that file is not decoded: its page length
field is not known to sit where the older ones keep it. Nothing is guessed.

What this tool never does is turn a failure into a clean result. Per file it says
parsed, partial, empty, unsupported or failed; per gzip member complete, truncated
or failed (with its compressed offset); per page parsed, unsupported, invalid
length or truncated; per record decoded, empty path or incomplete; and every byte
it could not place in a page is counted and its position named. Decoding is
streamed (a member is inflated a block at a time, a page is held while it is
read), expansion is capped (`max_expanded_bytes`), and records go to the output as
they are decoded, never collected first.

The tool has a clock of its own (`max_seconds`, 200 by default): past it the file in hand is
closed as partial at the page it was reading, the files after it are `not_attempted`, and what was
decoded is in the output. A file of many gzip members is read in linear time. Every path passes
the boundary below before it is printed or written, and `contains` is a regular expression in a
restricted subset, matched on the path as printed, under a timer. SIGTERM, SIGINT and SIGHUP end
the run the same way as the clock does, with one JSON answer and the exit code 128 plus the signal.

# BEGIN SHARED BOUNDARY
# WINDOWS BOUNDARY v1: the same text is in every windows-forensics tool that prints names, paths, event data, registry data or table
# cells from evidence (a windows-forensics test holds the copies equal), so that the shared-block task can converge it with the other
# withholding blocks. It is the owner-approved HYBRID design: an allow-list for identifier-shaped fields, a deny-list for free text,
# and an independent backstop on the way out.
#
# LAYER 1, an allow-list per field type. A string the evidence supplied is shown as it is only when it fits the plain grammar of the
# type of the field it fills: a name (registry key and value names, event field names, provider and channel names, table and column
# names), a path (file names and paths, a registry path, a URL path), a key, a URL, or a typed id (GUID, SID, MAC, IP address, digest,
# time, number, version). The grammar is: letters of any script, digits, space and `_ - . $ @ ? : ~ + , # ( ) [ ] { } ' < > *`, at
# most 128 characters a component, no user-info shape (a `:` before an `@`), and no chain of 16 or more characters made of
# random-looking pieces (pieces that break into one- and two-character parts, flip between letters and digits, or are letters with
# no pronounceable word in them; a 16-hex id, a GUID or a number up to 18 digits is plain). Below 16 characters a chain is shown
# whatever it looks like: a short random password in a name is not recognised. A path is judged component by component and only the
# offending span is replaced; a string with a format, control or combining character is withheld whole.
#
# LAYER 2, for every kind, and it reads the string FIRST, as the evidence wrote it (the deny-list and the grammar cut spans out of a string
# and take with them the context these rules need: the user of `user:password@host`, the characters glued before `glpat-`): user-info up
# to the last `@` before the host (the password may hold a `/`, not a port); the value after a secret's name (password, secret, token,
# api/access/account/private key, credential, auth) found anywhere, up to a space or quote, and past a `& ; ,` that no `name=` follows;
# a PEM private key; a vendor token with its own prefix (AKIA, gh?_, github_pat_, xox?-, glpat-, sk_live_, SG., AIza, npm_, dop_v1_,
# ya29., sk-, JWT) in any case; a base64 key with its padding; and the same rules on a copy with invisible characters taken out and NFKC
# applied (a hit withholds the whole string). FREE TEXT (event data, messages, command lines, registry data strings, table cells) is on
# the deny-list: the same chain test applied to the text with its typed ids (GUID, SID, IP address, time, labelled digest, number) left
# alone, plus layer 2, and no character grammar.
#
# LAYER 3, the backstop, written apart from the layers above: every key and value of what is about to be written is read once more
# by its own normaliser and patterns (a PEM marker, a named secret, a run of 19 or more digits, a token prefix in any case, user-info, a
# run of 40 or more hex digits outside a typed field, a base64 run, a run that changes class as random text does; a typed field must hold
# the characters of its type; data written as hexadecimal is decoded and its printable text is read as text). It reads the shown string
# AND the original: a window of 12 characters of anything it calls secret in the original that is still in the shown string means the
# layers above left a piece of a secret between two cuts. A string it finds suspect is replaced by <withheld N bytes: backstop: why>,
# counted, its place named in boundary.replaced_at (built from the keys on the way as they are SHOWN, or their positions), and the
# answer is partial. A placeholder is only a placeholder when its reason is one of the fixed list. The names of the components of the Windows
# component store (WinSxS: lower case, a public key token, a language or `none`, a hash) are not judged by the backstop in a name or key slot:
# a real SOFTWARE hive lists them by the thousand and their hash looked random to it; layer 1 judges them as it does every name.
#
# ONE WAY OUT: emit() writes an answer, row_text() a row of a paging file, and both seal every key and value first (a value that is not
# a string, a number or a container is sealed as the text str() makes of it). Binary data written as hex (a REG_BINARY value, an ESE
# binary column) is decoded and its printable views (Latin-1, UTF-16LE and UTF-16BE, and runs holding full-width characters read as UTF-8 and UTF-16LE with
# the width folded) are judged by the free-text rules, by both layers and the
# backstop; hex that holds a secret-shaped text is withheld, and any other hex is shown (random bytes with no text in them are printed).
# What is withheld is a placeholder with its length and the reason; its original goes to the values file only when write_values was
# asked for in a job run as secret output. A list of names is printed in the order of the text shown for each, the placeholders of
# withheld names in a random order that is new every run (print_order); a `contains` filter is applied to the text the answer PRINTS (the
# string after the layers and the backstop, sealed_text), never to what is withheld or replaced, and contains_check says when the needle
# could have been in what is hidden. Every string is judged in linear time (a string is read to 256 KiB, the pieces the backstop compares
# are at most 64, a PEM body at most 20,000 characters), and an answer or a row that takes longer than SEAL_BUDGET seconds to seal, or that is
# still being sealed at the seal stop of the tool (seal_stop_after: a point in time after which nothing is judged, not a stop of the tool's own
# work, which has its own clock), has the rest of its strings replaced whole (<withheld N bytes: backstop: the judging time ran out>) and is
# partial; what stays readable past that point is the names the tool made itself (OWN_NAMES) and strings of 15 characters or fewer of letters,
# digits, `_` and `.` that do not start like a vendor token (and, in a field of a typed kind, fit the grammar of its type). The seal stop is 3.5 seconds before the
# tool's time limit: the string in progress finishes after it, and one string of 256 KiB takes up to 2.3 seconds to judge on a loaded machine (the worst measured).
# NOT RECOGNISED, by design: a secret that does not look like one (a plain password, a pronounceable passphrase, a UUID-shaped key,
# anything under 16 characters in a name, a secret hidden in words or in an encoding this block does not read).

# windows-forensics pack's and is not edited here; these are the two checks this pack makes around it until the block itself is revised, and they call only what
# the block already has.
#  - guard_hex: data written as hexadecimal is judged by the block as printable runs of the bytes as they are, so a token that a NUL, an invisible character or a
#    control character cuts into pieces of 15 characters or fewer shows no run that looks like a secret, and is printed whole. A field that is hex (a BLOB's head,
#    a UUID, the raw bytes of a path) is judged here once more on the text the bytes make with the NULs and the invisible characters (format characters, combining
#    marks, private-use and unassigned code points, fillers) taken out, in UTF-8 and in UTF-16 (both byte orders and offsets), the way the block reads a text; and
#    once more for every control character that occurs in that text, with that one character taken out. It is withheld when one of these
#    texts holds a secret-shaped run. (Taking out all control characters at once would join the printable bytes of random data into runs: 1% of 4 KB of random
#    bytes then held a random-looking run. A token cut by two or more different control characters is not read through.) A field so long and so full of control
#    characters that this would take more than _VIEW_WORK characters of reading is withheld.
#  - guard_text: a FileVault personal recovery key (six groups of four capitals and digits, 2-9, joined by `-`) is not a shape the block knows; it is withheld here.
#    The id of a user's temporary folder (`/var/folders/xx/` and 30 characters) that the block would withhold as a token is shown as an alias of its sha256.
#  - emit_answer: the answer is printed as emit() prints it, but a stop signal that arrived while it was sealed is named in it; one that arrives while the text is
#    made or written cannot be (the text is out), and is found afterwards: the exit code is the signal's and stderr says that the answer is whole.
#  - print_order_until: print_order() under a clock, for a list that may be as long as a hostile file makes it.
# Both withhold through the block's own _withheld, so they are counted, listed and written to the values file like everything else it withholds.
