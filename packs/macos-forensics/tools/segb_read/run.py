"""Decode the framing of SEGB files (the container of Apple's Biome streams): frames, their state and their times, the payload only as a structure.

Biome keeps its streams as SEGB files (under ~/Library/Biome/streams/ on macOS and on iOS; the file names are numbers and the stream is named by the
directories above). A SEGB file frames records; what a record holds is a payload, usually protobuf, which this tool does not interpret. Two framings are
decoded, and the version is told from the magic and from nothing else:

* SEGB1: the magic `SEGB` at offset 52 of a 56-byte header whose first four bytes (little-endian) are the end-of-data offset; then frames, each a 32-byte
  header (length int32, state int32, two Apple absolute times as doubles, 8 bytes not decoded and not shown) followed by `length` payload bytes, the next
  frame at the next multiple of 8.
* SEGB2: the magic `SEGB` at offset 0 of a 32-byte header holding the number of frames (int32 at 4) and a creation time (double at 8); then a table of one
  16-byte entry per frame (end offset int32, state int32, time double), then the payloads, each ending at its entry's end offset (relative to the start of the
  payload area) and the next starting at the next multiple of 8.

THE SOURCE OF THESE LAYOUTS. They are written from public reverse-engineering notes of the two formats (the ccl-segb project of CCL Solutions Group and the
Biome notes of the iLEAPP community), recalled and not checked against Apple's own sources or against a sample file in this repository: the tests build their
files from this description, so they show that the tool reads what the description says, and not that the description is Apple's. Every answer says so
(`layout_basis`). A file whose magic is neither is `unsupported`, a version is never guessed, and a file that fits a layout in its magic but not in its
bounds (an end offset past the file, a frame count the file cannot hold, an end offset that goes backwards) is reported as failing the layout, never decoded
by luck.

What a frame carries: `offset` and `payload_offset` in the file, `payload_length`, `state_raw` (1 and 3 are given a name, written and deleted, as the notes
do; any other number is raw only), and the two container times `time1_raw`, `time2_raw` with their UTC reading when they are plausible (a date between 2001
and 2100). Which of the two is the write time, the harvest time or something else is NOT established here, and neither is the payload's own time, which lives
inside the payload and is not decoded: a container time is not the time of the event. A deleted state is a record lifecycle in storage, not proof that a person
deleted anything. No checksum field of the frame is shown, and none is computed: a checksum of a payload is a digest of it.

The payload is shown as a protobuf view and nothing else: the first 16 KiB are walked as tags (field number, wire type, offset, and for a length-delimited
field its length), at most 64 tags are listed, no value, string or byte of the payload is shown, and `confidence` says how much a clean walk means: bytes of
any kind parse as protobuf by chance, so a clean walk of a short payload is weak evidence, and a payload that starts `bplist00` is named as a property list
and not walked. The stream is named from the path the file was found at (`stream_from_path`), which is the examiner's copy and not a field of the file.

Every file is opened without waiting (a FIFO has no writer) and without following a link, used only if it is a regular file, and read in pieces: a frame's
header and the head of its payload, never the whole file in memory. The read is bounded by the tool's own clock (`max_seconds`), with `resume.skip_frames` to go
on; SIGTERM, SIGINT and SIGHUP end it with one JSON answer and exit 128 plus the signal. Every string passes the boundary below.
"""

# BEGIN SHARED ENDS
# The same text is in every pack tool and recipe and in their tool-library twins, before the file's own imports (tests/shared-blocks-census.test.ts
# holds the copies equal): the two ends of a call, where a stop signal (SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGHUP) found no handler, or one that did harm.
# * The start. From here a stop is answered by ONE JSON document and exit 128 + the signal, until the tool installs its own handlers (which then
#   answer it), and for good for a signal the tool never takes. Only the start of the interpreter and the compiling of the file come before
#   it: a stop there ends the process with no answer, before anything was read. answer_a_stop() is that document: a handler whose own last word
#   wrote nothing on standard output calls it before it ends the process, so that a stop is never answered by silence.
# * The end. The interpreter's own teardown resets the handlers to their defaults before it frees what the call held, and a stop that landed
#   there killed a process that had printed its whole answer; a handler that raises, writes a last word or ends the process, run once the
#   answer was decided, wrote a second document, a traceback, or nothing at all. Python runs a handler on the main thread whichever thread the
#   signal reached, so a mask of the main thread alone holds nothing while another thread runs. hold_stop_signals() holds the stop signals for
#   good: blocked in this thread and given a handler that does nothing, which is the hold whatever thread the signal reaches; an error Python
#   can only report from then on (a file left open whose last write the file system refuses, closed when the frame that held it is freed) is
#   not printed (3.11 and 3.12 say nothing of it, 3.14 a traceback). A handler that was due runs on the way in: what it raises reaches the
#   writer that asked (the tool's own handling then answers the stop, before any byte of the answer), or, quietly, is dropped (the end of a
#   call, an error branch). Every writer of a final answer calls it before it commits to writing, every error branch at the end calls it
#   quietly, and, when the file runs as a program, standard output is wrapped so that its first write calls it too. _code(stop) is a
#   SystemExit's exit code (its text, if it has one, goes to standard error as the interpreter puts it), and _leave(code) ends the call: both
#   hold the signals first, quietly; _leave flushes
#   standard output (a write that fails there makes a 0 an exit 120, as the interpreter does) and standard error, runs the atexit hooks (a hook
#   that removes a temporary file), each step on its own and none able to raise, and ends the process with os._exit, never through the teardown.
# The modules are imported here, as the file is loaded, never inside the ending (an import there ran a due handler inside the import system).

# THE CALLS A TOOL MAKES, and what the virtualization block called each (the three virtualization tools moved onto this text; the table is what they map to):
#   FIELDS, KEY_KINDS, bind_fields(table, key_kinds)           the table of field kinds, which the CALLER passes in (this text holds no tool's table);
#                                                              it was _FIELDS, _INHERIT and field_kind(); a digit run in a field name stands for any number
#                                                              (`ethernet#.address`), and a field the table does not list has the kind of the field above it
#   T(kind, text), show(s, kind, field)                        one string judged by its kind                         (the Shower, boundary_text, seal_text, seal_head)
#   sealed_text(text, kind, field), print_order(items, ...)    what an answer prints for a string; nothing counted    (seal_text without the count)
#   bind_values(enabled, tool), close_values(), values_summary()  the values file of a secret_output job            (bind_run(values, seconds))
#   seal_stop_after(seconds)                                   the clock: nothing is judged after it                  (bind_run's seconds, RUN["deadline"])
#   row_object(row)                                            one row of a paging file                               (row_text(row, where))
#   answer_object(doc), emit(doc)                              an answer, sealed and read back                        (answer_text(doc), backstop(value, where))
#   boundary_summary()                                         the "boundary" object; stopped_by is in it when judging stopped
#   OWN_NAMES                                                  the exact strings the run made and shows as they are   (OWN_NAMES)
# The kinds of a field: text (the default), name, path, key, url, host, hex, id (one of several forms of identifier: a GUID, a VMFS volume id, a device id, a VMware uuid, a MAC, a content id of 32 hexadecimal digits or a number; else a name), and the typed ones guid, digest, sid, mac, ip, time, number, version
# and, for virtualized storage and machines, vmfs (a VMFS volume id), device (naa., eui., wwn-0x, vml. and t10. ids), iqn, vmuuid (the VMware
# uuid of a machine), cid (a disk's content id), winhost (the name Windows gives a machine nobody named).
#
# LAYER 1, an allow-list per field type. A string the evidence supplied is shown as it is only when it fits the plain grammar of the
# type of the field it fills: a name (registry key and value names, event field names, provider and channel names, table and column
# names), a path (file names and paths, a registry path, a URL path), a key, a URL, or a typed id (GUID, SID, MAC, IP address, digest,
# time, number, version). The grammar is: letters of any script, digits, space and `_ - . $ @ ? : ~ + , # ( ) [ ] { } ' < > *`, at
# most 128 characters a component, no user-info shape (a `:` before an `@`), and no chain of 16 or more characters made of
# random-looking pieces (pieces that break into one- and two-character parts, flip between letters and digits, or are letters with
# no pronounceable word in them; a 16-hex id, a GUID or a number up to 18 digits is plain). Below 16 characters a chain is shown
# whatever it looks like: a short random password in a name is not recognised. A path is judged component by component and only the
# offending span is replaced; a string with a format, control or combining character is withheld whole.
#
# LAYER 2, for every kind, and it reads the string FIRST, as the evidence wrote it (the deny-list and the grammar cut spans out of a string
# and take with them the context these rules need: the user of `user:password@host`, the characters glued before `glpat-`): user-info up
# to the last `@` before the host (the password may hold a `/`, not a port); the value after a secret's name (password, secret, token,
# api/access/account/private key, credential, auth) found anywhere, up to a space or quote, and past a `& ; ,` that no `name=` follows;
# a PEM private key; a vendor token with its own prefix (AKIA, gh?_, github_pat_, xox?-, glpat-, sk_live_, SG., AIza, npm_, dop_v1_,
# ya29., sk-, JWT) in any case; a base64 key with its padding; and the same rules on a copy with invisible characters taken out and NFKC
# applied (a hit withholds the whole string). FREE TEXT (event data, messages, command lines, registry data strings, table cells) is on
# the deny-list: the same chain test applied to the text with its typed ids (GUID, SID, IP address, time, labelled digest, number) left
# alone, plus layer 2, and no character grammar.
#
# LAYER 3, the backstop, written apart from the layers above: every key and value of what is about to be written is read once more
# by its own normaliser and patterns (a PEM marker, a named secret, a run of 19 or more digits, a token prefix in any case, user-info, a
# run of 40 or more hex digits outside a typed field, a base64 run, a run that changes class as random text does; a typed field must hold
# the characters of its type; data written as hexadecimal is decoded and its printable text is read as text). It reads the shown string
# AND the original: a window of 12 characters of anything it calls secret in the original that is still in the shown string means the
# layers above left a piece of a secret between two cuts. A string it finds suspect is replaced by <withheld N bytes: backstop: why>,
# counted, its place named in boundary.replaced_at (built from the keys on the way as they are SHOWN, or their positions), and the
# answer is partial. A placeholder is only a placeholder when its reason is one of the fixed list. The names of the components of the Windows
# component store (WinSxS: lower case, a public key token, a language or `none`, a hash) are not judged by the backstop in a name or key slot:
# a real SOFTWARE hive lists them by the thousand and their hash looked random to it; layer 1 judges them as it does every name.
#
# ONE WAY OUT: emit() writes an answer, row_object() makes a row of a paging file, and both seal every key and value first (a value that is not
# a string, a number or a container is sealed as the text str() makes of it). Binary data written as hex (a REG_BINARY value, an ESE
# binary column) is decoded and its printable views (Latin-1, UTF-16LE and UTF-16BE, and runs holding full-width characters read as UTF-8 and UTF-16LE with
# the width folded) are judged by the free-text rules, by both layers and the
# backstop; hex that holds a secret-shaped text is withheld, and any other hex is shown (random bytes with no text in them are printed).
# What is withheld is a placeholder with its length and the reason; its original goes to the values file only when write_values was
# asked for in a job run as secret output. A list of names is printed in the order of the text shown for each, the placeholders of
# withheld names in a random order that is new every run (print_order); a `contains` filter is applied to the text the answer PRINTS (the
# string after the layers and the backstop, sealed_text), never to what is withheld or replaced, and contains_check says when the needle
# could have been in what is hidden. Every string is judged in linear time (a string is read to 256 KiB, the pieces the backstop compares
# are at most 64, a PEM body at most 20,000 characters), and an answer or a row that takes longer than SEAL_BUDGET seconds to seal, or that is
# still being sealed at the seal stop of the tool (seal_stop_after: a point in time after which nothing is judged, not a stop of the tool's own
# work, which has its own clock), has the rest of its strings replaced whole (<withheld N bytes: backstop: the judging time ran out>) and is
# partial; what stays readable past that point is the names the tool made itself (OWN_NAMES) and strings of 15 characters or fewer of letters,
# digits, `_` and `.` that do not start like a vendor token (and, in a field of a typed kind, fit the grammar of its type). The seal stop is 3.5 seconds before the
# tool's time limit: the string in progress finishes after it, and one string of 256 KiB takes up to 2.3 seconds to judge on a loaded machine (the worst measured).
# A run has a second bound: past MAX_JUDGED_CHARS characters judged (the final answer is always judged), a string not judged before is withheld by its size in the
# same way. boundary.stopped_by says which bound stopped the judging and boundary.strings_withheld_by_the_stop how many strings it withheld; the answer is partial.
# NOT RECOGNISED, by design: a secret that does not look like one (a plain password, a pronounceable passphrase, a UUID-shaped key,
# anything under 16 characters in a name, a secret hidden in words or in an encoding this block does not read).

# windows-forensics pack's and is not edited here; these are the two checks this pack makes around it until the block itself is revised, and they call only what
# the block already has.
#  - guard_hex: data written as hexadecimal is judged by the block as printable runs of the bytes as they are, so a token that a NUL, an invisible character or a
#    control character cuts into pieces of 15 characters or fewer shows no run that looks like a secret, and is printed whole. A field that is hex (a BLOB's head,
#    a UUID, the raw bytes of a path) is judged here once more on the text the bytes make with the NULs and the invisible characters (format characters, combining
#    marks, private-use and unassigned code points, fillers) taken out, in UTF-8 and in UTF-16 (both byte orders and offsets), the way the block reads a text; and
#    once more for every control character that occurs in that text, with that one character taken out. It is withheld when one of these
#    texts holds a secret-shaped run. (Taking out all control characters at once would join the printable bytes of random data into runs: 1% of 4 KB of random
#    bytes then held a random-looking run. A token cut by two or more different control characters is not read through.) A field so long and so full of control
#    characters that this would take more than _VIEW_WORK characters of reading is withheld.
#  - guard_text: a FileVault personal recovery key (six groups of four capitals and digits, 2-9, joined by `-`) is not a shape the block knows; it is withheld here.
#    The id of a user's temporary folder (`/var/folders/xx/` and 30 characters) that the block would withhold as a token is shown as an alias of its sha256.
#  - emit_answer: the answer is printed as emit() prints it, but a stop signal that arrived while it was sealed is named in it; one that arrives while the text is
#    made or written cannot be (the text is out), and is found afterwards: the exit code is the signal's and stderr says that the answer is whole.
#  - print_order_until: print_order() under a clock, for a list that may be as long as a hostile file makes it.
