"""SHA-256 and fuzzy hashes of one file, or a comparison of two, for static sample clustering.

SHA-256 is computed here, from the bytes, and establishes identity. ssdeep and TLSH are computed by the
installed programs and measure byte similarity only; they are leads, not attribution, and a score between
two files is a statement about their bytes.

Each engine runs on its own, under a time limit, with its whole output kept in a log file under the tool-output
directory (in a job, under $OUT) and none of it held in memory. A digest is accepted only when it has the shape
of that engine's digest: any other text is a diagnostic, never a digest. An engine that times out, fails, or
prints something unrecognised is a structured per-engine result and the answer is partial; the other engine's
result stands. A comparison that cannot be made names the input that prevented it. What each program printed for its
version command is recorded as printed.

# BEGIN SHARED ENDS
# The same text is in every pack tool and recipe and in their tool-library twins, before the file's own imports (tests/shared-blocks-census.test.ts
# holds the copies equal): the two ends of a call, where a stop signal (SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGHUP) found no handler, or one that did harm.
# * The start. From here a stop is answered by ONE JSON document and exit 128 + the signal, until the tool installs its own handlers (which then
#   answer it), and for good for a signal the tool never takes. Only the start of the interpreter and the compiling of the file come before
#   it: a stop there ends the process with no answer, before anything was read. answer_a_stop() is that document: a handler whose own last word
#   wrote nothing on standard output calls it before it ends the process, so that a stop is never answered by silence.
# * The end. The interpreter's own teardown resets the handlers to their defaults before it frees what the call held, and a stop that landed
#   there killed a process that had printed its whole answer; a handler that raises, writes a last word or ends the process, run once the
#   answer was decided, wrote a second document, a traceback, or nothing at all. Python runs a handler on the main thread whichever thread the
#   signal reached, so a mask of the main thread alone holds nothing while another thread runs. hold_stop_signals() holds the stop signals for
#   good: blocked in this thread and given a handler that does nothing, which is the hold whatever thread the signal reaches; an error Python
#   can only report from then on (a file left open whose last write the file system refuses, closed when the frame that held it is freed) is
#   not printed (3.11 and 3.12 say nothing of it, 3.14 a traceback). A handler that was due runs on the way in: what it raises reaches the
#   writer that asked (the tool's own handling then answers the stop, before any byte of the answer), or, quietly, is dropped (the end of a
#   call, an error branch). Every writer of a final answer calls it before it commits to writing, every error branch at the end calls it
#   quietly, and, when the file runs as a program, standard output is wrapped so that its first write calls it too. _code(stop) is a
#   SystemExit's exit code (its text, if it has one, goes to standard error as the interpreter puts it), and _leave(code) ends the call: both
#   hold the signals first, quietly; _leave flushes
#   standard output (a write that fails there makes a 0 an exit 120, as the interpreter does) and standard error, runs the atexit hooks (a hook
#   that removes a temporary file), each step on its own and none able to raise, and ends the process with os._exit, never through the teardown.

# The same text is in pcap_extract, zeek_run, suricata_run, the network-capture recipe and computer-forensics-base's
# archive_extract; tests/pack-network-withholding.test.ts holds the four network copies equal and tests/pack-base-shared.test.ts
# holds archive_extract's to them. A program an engine tool runs is started in THIS tool's process group, never in a session of
# its own: the harness ends a tool that runs too long, or is aborted, by killing the tool's group (process.kill(-pid,
# SIGKILL)), and an engine in a group of its own goes on writing into the output directory after the tool is gone. On
# Linux the kernel is also asked to kill it if the tool dies. A deadline kills the program and what it started by
# walking the process tree, and SIGTERM, SIGINT and SIGHUP do the same and then give the tool a last word. Only what is
# below a program this tool started and has not yet waited for is ever signalled: the walk starts at that program's pid
# and nowhere else, and a program that has been waited for (its pid may be another process's by now) is left alone. The
# walk is bounded (MAX_ROUNDS and WALK_SECONDS, below). A stop signal is the one case that reaches further: it also
# ends everything below the tool itself (a program that was forked a moment before it was entered in ACTIVE is among it) and what
# the tool started and lost (reap_orphans): a process that was seen below the tool, in the tool's own group, and whose parent has since
# ended. Nothing else is ever ended: a process the tool never saw in its tree (the next stage of a pipeline the tool heads, a process a
# launcher put in the group) is left alone, whoever leads the group. A program that has ended while something it started still
# holds its pipes does not hold the tool: communicate_bounded gives the pipes PIPE_GRACE seconds (and POST_EXIT_BYTES bytes) and goes on without them.
# The walk below a program is bounded: MAX_ROUNDS rounds and WALK_SECONDS seconds. Each process is stopped (SIGSTOP) as the walk finds it,
# so one that forks fast cannot outrun the walk; the walk is repeated for what the stopped ones had already forked, and the stopped set is
# then killed. A tree that is still growing at the bound is left, and process_notes() says so.
# Before a pid other than the program itself is signalled, its identity is read again (same_process(pid, ident)): the start time, from
# /proc/<pid>/stat (field 22, counted after the last ")") on Linux, from libproc's PROC_PIDTBSDINFO (pbi_start_tvsec, pbi_start_tvusec;
# written from <sys/proc_info.h>, not run on macOS in this repository's tests) on macOS, and from `ps -o lstart=` (to the second: coarse)
# where neither answers. The parent is no part of it: a child is re-parented when its parent ends, and is still the process that was
# listed. A pid that is gone, or whose start time is not the listed one, is left alone; a pid whose start time could not be read when it
# was listed is signalled only if it can be read now and is in the tool's own group; a ps listing that gave no start time (a minimal ps) is
# checked only for the pid still being there.
# A tree that cannot be listed (ps fails, lists nothing or needs more than PS_WAIT seconds, /proc cannot be read or takes more than
# TABLE_SECONDS) is never taken as an empty one: list_descendants raises TreeNotListed, the program itself is still ended, and a sentence
# in process_notes() says that the tree could not be listed (communicate_bounded also appends it to the stderr bytes it returns when it
# ended the program at its deadline). descendants() is list_descendants for a caller that cannot take an exception (a signal handler): its
# list is empty and has not_listed = True when the tree could not be listed.
# Open: a pid that ends and is reused between the identity check and the signal (two calls) is signalled; the Linux rule that a member of
# the tool's own group that holds the tool's pipe is ended; on macOS a daemon that holds the pipes of a finished program is not found (no
# /proc/<pid>/fd); a tool SIGKILLed between the stop and the kill leaves the program and the stopped set stopped (the harness ends the
# tool's group, and with it the stopped ones that are in it); a carrier's answer carries program_group (process_verdict, process_notes)
# only where that carrier's own code calls process_apply (without the call a program's leftovers are ended but not reported); the start of the interpreter, before any handler is in, is a window a signal can land in.
# What a program leaves behind (settle). A program can exit by itself and leave a process that goes on writing a file the answer then reports:
# one in a session of its own, or one that holds none of the tool's descriptors, which neither the walk nor the pipes reach. On Linux spawn()
# makes the tool a subreaper (become_subreaper, PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER): such a process is adopted by the tool, so it is a direct child of the
# tool, and settle() ends it: when a program leaves ACTIVE after it has ended or been killed (ACTIVE is a list whose remove() does it), and at
# the end of communicate_bounded and inside kill_all. It ends only a child of the tool that is no program's own: not a program spawn() started
# (SPAWNED: Popen reaps those, their returncode is never taken), not one kept (KEEP, process_keep(pid), spawn(argv, leaves=True) for a
# program that leaves a process on purpose) and not a child the tool already had (PRE_KIDS). It stops each one, what it started with it (the
# walk above), kills and reaps them, for at most LEFTOVER_SECONDS, reading the clock for every process. While another program is running in
# ACTIVE nothing is ended and the answer says it is unproven. process_verdict() says what was found; process_apply(answer) puts it into an
# answer as program_group and turns a complete answer partial when a program left something or that could not be ruled out: a carrier
# calls it once where it prints its answer. Where nothing is adopted (not Linux, or the kernel refuses) settle() ends only what the tool saw
# below a program whose parent is gone, and the answer is unproven (NONLINUX_UNPROVEN_DOWNGRADE below is the one line that decides whether
# that alone makes a complete answer partial on a host that is not Linux). Not reached by any of this: a process that is not a descendant of
# a program (started through a service manager, a socket, another PID namespace), and the tool itself being killed (the harness ends its group).
# What a program's pipes deliver after it ended (the byte cap). communicate_bounded reads the pipes itself (a selector, not
# Popen.communicate) and looks at the program after every read. From the moment the program has ended, or been killed at its deadline, it
# takes at most POST_EXIT_BYTES (1 MiB) more bytes from its two pipes together and at most PIPE_GRACE seconds, whichever comes first; a
# program's own last words are in the pipe already (a pipe holds far less than the cap), so only what a process that went on holding the
# pipe wrote can be cut. At the cap the tool stops reading, ends the holder (reap_orphans, settle) and lets the pipes go: PIPE_CUT["cut"]
# counts the calls cut that way, process_notes() says so, and process_apply turns a complete answer partial. The bytes kept are the ones
# read, not a whole stream: a caller that parses the output sees the program's output and at most 1 MiB of what a leftover wrote. While the
# program runs each stream has a running cap too (STDOUT_CAP 64 MiB, STDERR_CAP 8 MiB with its head and last STDERR_TAIL 1 MiB kept, or the
# caller's `caps`): past it the program is ended on the deadline's own path (kill_tree, its tree only), the stream comes back cut
# (Output.cut, output_cut()), OUTPUT_CUT counts the call and process_apply turns a complete answer partial; a caller that parses a cut
# output says so and never takes it for a whole one.
