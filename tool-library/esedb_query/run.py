"""Read an ESE (Extensible Storage Engine) database as tables.

The gap this closes is recorded in a delivered report's own words: "No
`esedbexport`: WebCacheV01.dat and spartan.edb could not be parsed as
tables". That file appears in four of the fifteen measured runs across 144
trace events and was never once read as tables. The same wrapper opens
SRUDB.dat (the System Resource Usage Monitor) and Edge's database, so one
tool covers three artefacts that a Windows case asks for every time.

Backed by `esedbexport` (libesedb), which writes one TSV per table into a
directory. This wraps it: list the tables, or read one, and return JSON either
way. It exports TABLES, as text: it does not decode what a table means (a SRUM
table is not joined to the application or user it names, a WebCache container
is not resolved to a browser), and it does not read an ESE log.

The export is made once per database, into `esedb-export/<sha256 of the database,
first 16 hex>/` under the job's $OUT (or the agent's own work directory), with the
exporter's whole standard output and standard error in files beside it and an
`export-manifest.json` that records the database's digest, the exporter's version, argv
and exit status and every table file. A later call with the same database reuses a
complete export. An exporter that exits non-zero, or is stopped by its time limit, leaves a
PARTIAL export: the answer says status: partial, never lists it as the database's tables,
and keeps the logs. A table name that matches more than one export file is refused with
the candidates, never resolved by taking the first. An earlier export is reused only when its
manifest was written by this version of the tool, its exit status was 0, and every table file
it lists is on disk with the size it recorded and nothing else is there; otherwise it is made again.

READING AND BOUNDS. The table file is read as the exporter wrote it: tab-separated text, a row to a line, no quoting rule (a quote is a
character of its cell; a carriage return is one too, unless the whole file ends its lines with CR LF, which the answer says), and `_row` is the
1-based line of the row after the header. What an answer prints inline is bounded: the rows that fit `limit` and 256 KiB, with a cell longer than
4,096 characters shown cut (`_cells_shortened` names it). The file `all_results` names holds EVERY row, its cells as the boundary shows them (sealed like the inline rows; the cells whole are in the export), and is written
whenever the inline rows are not the whole of the table (more rows than fit, or a cell cut); it is never replaced by another result. A row longer
than 8 MiB is read to that length (said, with its length) and is whole in the export. The tool stops at its own time limit (285 seconds, below the
manifest's 300) with the rows read and says partial; SIGTERM, SIGINT and SIGHUP end it with JSON (status interrupted) and no temporary file.

SENSITIVE OUTPUT. The export directory holds every table whole, so it holds whatever the database
holds (a WebCache URL with a token in it, a SRUM user, the password material of an Active Directory
database): it is made with mode 0700 (its files 0600), it is a sensitive output of the job that made it, and
it is cited by file and table, never by value. The answer withholds, in the rows it returns, the cells
of a column whose name says password, secret, token, encrypted, credential, a card, an IBAN or an SSN,
and of the attributes of an Active Directory datatable that carry password hashes, their history,
supplemental credentials and the password encryption keys, replacing each by a marker that holds only its
length (`columns_withheld`); and the secrets of every URL in a cell (a token or password in its query
string, fragment or user-info), listed in `url_secrets_withheld`. A URL's text is written whole only with
`write_url_secrets: true`, in a job run with secret_output: true, to a file under $OUT of mode 0600; the
request is refused anywhere else. Binary cells are exported as hexadecimal text by esedbexport; the boundary decodes them and judges their printable text.

# launcher put in the group) is left alone, whoever leads the group. A program that has ended while something it started still
# holds its pipes does not hold the tool: communicate_bounded gives the pipes PIPE_GRACE seconds and goes on without them. (In the
# windows lineage only the windows-artefacts recipe and lnk_jumplist call it; the lineage is one text, so the others carry it unused.)
# The walk below a program is bounded: MAX_ROUNDS rounds and WALK_SECONDS seconds. Each process is stopped (SIGSTOP) as the walk finds it,
# so one that forks fast cannot outrun the walk; the walk is repeated for what the stopped ones had already forked, and the stopped set is
# then killed. A tree that is still growing at the bound is left, and process_notes() says so.
# Before a pid other than the program itself is signalled, its identity is read again (same_process(pid, ident)): the start time, from
# /proc/<pid>/stat (field 22, counted after the last ")") on Linux, from libproc's PROC_PIDTBSDINFO (pbi_start_tvsec, pbi_start_tvusec;
# written from <sys/proc_info.h>, not run on macOS in this repository's tests) on macOS, and from `ps -o lstart=` (to the second: coarse)
# where neither answers. The parent is no part of it: a child is re-parented when its parent ends, and is still the process that was
# listed. A pid that is gone, or whose start time is not the listed one, is left alone; a pid whose start time could not be read when it
# was listed is signalled only if it can be read now and is in the tool's own group; a ps listing that gave no start time (a minimal ps) is
# checked only for the pid still being there.
# A tree that cannot be listed (ps fails, lists nothing or needs more than PS_WAIT seconds, /proc cannot be read or takes more than
# TABLE_SECONDS) is never taken as an empty one: list_descendants raises TreeNotListed, the program itself is still ended, and a sentence
# in process_notes() says that the tree could not be listed (communicate_bounded also appends it to the stderr bytes it returns when it
# ended the program at its deadline). descendants() is list_descendants for a caller that cannot take an exception (a signal handler): its
# list is empty and has not_listed = True when the tree could not be listed.
# Open: a pid that ends and is reused between the identity check and the signal (two calls) is signalled; the Linux rule that a member of
# the tool's own group that holds the tool's pipe is ended; on macOS a daemon that holds the pipes of a finished program is not found (no
# /proc/<pid>/fd); a tool SIGKILLed between the stop and the kill leaves the program and the stopped set stopped (the harness ends the
# tool's group, and with it the stopped ones that are in it); a carrier's answer says what process_notes() holds only where that carrier's
# own code reads it; the start of the interpreter, before any handler is in, is a window a signal can land in.

# cells from evidence (tests/pack-boundary-shared.test.ts finds every copy under packs/ and tool-library/ and holds them equal: one variant, 16 carriers).
# It is the owner-approved HYBRID design: an allow-list for
# identifier-shaped fields, a deny-list for free text, and an independent backstop on the way out.
#
# Names defined here start with _b_ or _B_ where another shared block of a tool could define the same name (the WITHHOLDING block has _withheld and _USERINFO).
# THE CALLS A TOOL MAKES, and what the virtualization block called each (the three virtualization tools moved onto this text; the table is what they map to):
#   FIELDS, KEY_KINDS, bind_fields(table, key_kinds)           the table of field kinds, which the CALLER passes in (this text holds no tool's table);
#                                                              it was _FIELDS, _INHERIT and field_kind(); a digit run in a field name stands for any number
#                                                              (`ethernet#.address`), and a field the table does not list has the kind of the field above it
#   T(kind, text), show(s, kind, field)                        one string judged by its kind                         (the Shower, boundary_text, seal_text, seal_head)
#   sealed_text(text, kind, field), print_order(items, ...)    what an answer prints for a string; nothing counted    (seal_text without the count)
#   bind_values(enabled, tool), close_values(), values_summary()  the values file of a secret_output job            (bind_run(values, seconds))
#   seal_stop_after(seconds)                                   the clock: nothing is judged after it                  (bind_run's seconds, RUN["deadline"])
#   row_object(row)                                            one row of a paging file                               (row_text(row, where))

# The kinds of a field: text (the default), name, path, key, url, host, hex, and the typed ones guid, digest, sid, mac, ip, time, number, version
# and, for virtualized storage and machines, vmfs (a VMFS volume id), device (naa., eui., wwn-0x, vml. and t10. ids), iqn, vmuuid (the VMware
# uuid of a machine), cid (a disk's content id), winhost (the name Windows gives a machine nobody named).
#
# LAYER 1, an allow-list per field type. A string the evidence supplied is shown as it is only when it fits the plain grammar of the
# type of the field it fills: a name (registry key and value names, event field names, provider and channel names, table and column
# names), a path (file names and paths, a registry path, a URL path), a key, a URL, or a typed id (GUID, SID, MAC, IP address, digest,
# time, number, version). The grammar is: letters of any script, digits, space and `_ - . $ @ ? : ~ + , # ( ) [ ] { } ' < > *`, at
# most 128 characters a component, no user-info shape (a `:` before an `@`), and no chain of 16 or more characters made of
# random-looking pieces (pieces that break into one- and two-character parts, flip between letters and digits, or are letters with
# no pronounceable word in them; a 16-hex id, a GUID or a number up to 18 digits is plain). Below 16 characters a chain is shown
# whatever it looks like: a short random password in a name is not recognised. A path is judged component by component and only the
# offending span is replaced; a string with a format, control or combining character is withheld whole.
#
# LAYER 2, for every kind, and it reads the string FIRST, as the evidence wrote it (the deny-list and the grammar cut spans out of a string
# and take with them the context these rules need: the user of `user:password@host`, the characters glued before `glpat-`): user-info up
# to the last `@` before the host (the password may hold a `/`, not a port); the value after a secret's name (password, secret, token,
# api/access/account/private key, credential, auth) found anywhere, up to a space or quote, and past a `& ; ,` that no `name=` follows;
# a PEM private key; a vendor token with its own prefix (AKIA, gh?_, github_pat_, xox?-, glpat-, sk_live_, SG., AIza, npm_, dop_v1_,
# ya29., sk-, JWT) in any case; a base64 key with its padding; and the same rules on a copy with invisible characters taken out and NFKC
# applied (a hit withholds the whole string). FREE TEXT (event data, messages, command lines, registry data strings, table cells) is on
# the deny-list: the same chain test applied to the text with its typed ids (GUID, SID, IP address, time, labelled digest, number) left
# alone, plus layer 2, and no character grammar.
#
# LAYER 3, the backstop, written apart from the layers above: every key and value of what is about to be written is read once more
# by its own normaliser and patterns (a PEM marker, a named secret, a run of 19 or more digits, a token prefix in any case, user-info, a
# run of 40 or more hex digits outside a typed field, a base64 run, a run that changes class as random text does; a typed field must hold
# the characters of its type; data written as hexadecimal is decoded and its printable text is read as text). It reads the shown string
# AND the original: a window of 12 characters of anything it calls secret in the original that is still in the shown string means the
# layers above left a piece of a secret between two cuts. A string it finds suspect is replaced by <withheld N bytes: backstop: why>,
# counted, its place named in boundary.replaced_at (built from the keys on the way as they are SHOWN, or their positions), and the
# answer is partial. A placeholder is only a placeholder when its reason is one of the fixed list. The names of the components of the Windows
# component store (WinSxS: lower case, a public key token, a language or `none`, a hash) are not judged by the backstop in a name or key slot:
# a real SOFTWARE hive lists them by the thousand and their hash looked random to it; layer 1 judges them as it does every name.
#
# ONE WAY OUT: emit() writes an answer, row_text() a row of a paging file, and both seal every key and value first (a value that is not
# a string, a number or a container is sealed as the text str() makes of it). Binary data written as hex (a REG_BINARY value, an ESE
# binary column) is decoded and its printable views (Latin-1, UTF-16LE and UTF-16BE, and runs holding full-width characters read as UTF-8 and UTF-16LE with
# the width folded) are judged by the free-text rules, by both layers and the
# backstop; hex that holds a secret-shaped text is withheld, and any other hex is shown (random bytes with no text in them are printed).
# What is withheld is a placeholder with its length and the reason; its original goes to the values file only when write_values was
# asked for in a job run as secret output. A list of names is printed in the order of the text shown for each, the placeholders of
# withheld names in a random order that is new every run (print_order); a `contains` filter is applied to the text the answer PRINTS (the
# string after the layers and the backstop, sealed_text), never to what is withheld or replaced, and contains_check says when the needle
# could have been in what is hidden. Every string is judged in linear time (a string is read to 256 KiB, the pieces the backstop compares
# are at most 64, a PEM body at most 20,000 characters), and an answer or a row that takes longer than SEAL_BUDGET seconds to seal, or that is
# still being sealed at the seal stop of the tool (seal_stop_after: a point in time after which nothing is judged, not a stop of the tool's own
# work, which has its own clock), has the rest of its strings replaced whole (<withheld N bytes: backstop: the judging time ran out>) and is
# partial; what stays readable past that point is the names the tool made itself (OWN_NAMES) and strings of 15 characters or fewer of letters,
# digits, `_` and `.` that do not start like a vendor token (and, in a field of a typed kind, fit the grammar of its type). The seal stop is 3.5 seconds before the
# tool's time limit: the string in progress finishes after it, and one string of 256 KiB takes up to 2.3 seconds to judge on a loaded machine (the worst measured).
# A run has a second bound: past MAX_JUDGED_CHARS characters judged (the final answer is always judged), a string not judged before is withheld by its size in the
# same way. boundary.stopped_by says which bound stopped the judging and boundary.strings_withheld_by_the_stop how many strings it withheld; the answer is partial.
# NOT RECOGNISED, by design: a secret that does not look like one (a plain password, a pronounceable passphrase, a UUID-shaped key,
# anything under 16 characters in a name, a secret hidden in words or in an encoding this block does not read).
